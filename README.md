# dsecodingproject
This interactive project visualizes historical global temperature changes using data from 1750 onward. Users can select a year to view a world map highlighting cities with the largest temperature ranges for that period, alongside a time series showing temperature trends for a chosen city.

Additionally, the app offers an optimal travel route from Beijing to Los Angeles by guiding the user to the warmest city among the three closest ones at each step, all based on the previously selected year.
